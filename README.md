# JazzWikia
Project has been throw to trashbin, because it has many design flaws and code is too messy. Backend JS(nodejs) aint imo good. I rather have python and sql backend thatn js and mongodb, but I learned lot.

## Critical missing features
* Create PC characters
* Manage encounters with tracker with turnes and hit location/willpowers of pc's and npc's
* Easy to look UIX. Right now 3 different looking way to crate things and see what have been created. It's horrific to look at more than 10s
* Backend code structure aint good and should have been used typescript. My skill on programming has improved to create better react code and backend. Better to create from 0 than refactor already failed project
